## Introduction

Ah, austerity. It's just as british as tea-time, David Cameron’s secret society, and the Queen’s two birthdays. It was never intended to become an institution, but a whole generation of children have grown up in it, therefore jeopardizing their social mobility.   

A UK government surplus in 2001/2 was succeeded with years of budget deficit, after the financial crash in 2007/8, Britain was launched into a recession. So the conservatives, evicted labour from number 10, and introduced the first austerity measures in 2010, alongside the liberal democrats.

David Cameron coined ‘the age of austerity’, which he’d rebranded from the years following World War II. In his 2009 keynote speech to the Conservative Party forum he declared that "the age of irresponsibility is giving way to the age of austerity" and committed himself to ending years of what he characterised as excessive government spending.

The first austerity programme was initiated in 2010 by the conservative and liberal democrat coalition government. The Chancellor George Osborne identified two goals in his 2010 budget speech. The first, reduce the UK’s budget deficit, second reduce national debt as a percentage of GDP. For this to be achieved, a combination of public spending reductions and tax increases amounting to £110 billion, would be implemented and end in the 2015/16 financial year.

Theresa May finally declared ‘austerity is over’ on October 3 2018.

“We got there in the end - a remarkable national effort. Thank you.” decreed George Osborne on Twitter. Two years after the original austerity deadline. 

>“Austerity is devastating these communities. The working poor, public sector workers, the disabled, and the vulnerable, are the hardest hit by this bankrupt and ideologically driven policy.” famously said Martin McGuinness, an Irish republican politician who, as a member of Sinn Féin, was the deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland for a decade.

In this series of articles, I intend to explore how children in the UK growing up in ‘the age of austerity’ have been affected, chiefly in terms of education and its effect on children’s prospects. 

Between 1998 and 2012 the number of children living in "relative poverty" in the UK had fallen by approximately 800,000 to a total of around 3.5 million. 2012’s Welfare Reform Act, increased the number of children in “relative poverty”. In 2019 1.4 million children will live in relative poverty.  In the years between 2012 and 2019, the number of children obtaining food from The Trussell Trust more than tripled. 

Education, alongside healthcare, was ring fenced and therefore protected from cuts in 2010. But it’s budget has not risen in line with inflation, the rising number of children and a lack of teachers. 

The money from local authorities and councils that would usually bridge these gaps was cut so dramatically they couldn’t keep up. The Local Government Association identified a decrease
in UK Government funding of almost 60 per cent for local authorities in England and Wales between 2010 and 2020. 

This reduction in central government funding for county councils in England combined with an increasing demand for social care services has caused reductions in a variety of local expenditure. Public libraries, bin collections, road maintenance, and Sure Start - the programme targeted to increasing education in families with kids under the age of four living in the most disadvantaged areas - and steep increases to council tax rates and the introduction of additional charges for county council services have been the most effected.
